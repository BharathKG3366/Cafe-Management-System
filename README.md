# Cafe-Management-System

Description:

A user-friendly application designed to manage cafe operations such as order processing, billing, and inventory.
Built with Python for core logic, using a GUI library (like Tkinter) for visual interface.
Connects to a MySQL database to store persistent data: menu items, orders, customers, and transactions.
Features include adding/modifying menu items, recording orders, generating bills, and viewing sales reports.
Allows multiple users to operate simultaneously with data consistency.
Key Points:

Python GUI: Utilizes Tkinter for creating forms, buttons, labels, and data display components.
MySQL Integration: Uses mysql-connector-python to connect Python with MySQL database for CRUD operations.
Database Design: Tables for menu, orders, order details, customers, and sales reports.
Functionality: Easy to add/update menu items, take customer orders, generate bills, and view reports.
User Experience: Simple interface for staff, with minimal training required.
Data Security: Basic validation and error handling implemented to prevent data corruption.
Extendability: Modular code structure allows future enhancements like online ordering or inventory tracking.
Summary: This system simplifies cafe management by integrating Python, GUI, and MySQL. It streamlines order processing, inventory management, and billing, improving efficiency and accuracy. The intuitive GUI ensures ease of use, while MySQL provides reliable data storage. This project serves as a practical example for learning database connectivity, GUI development, and system design in Python.
